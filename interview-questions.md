# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: In React, props allows the state of a parent class to pass data to the child classes. For example, when I was working on tic-tac-toe game I used props to pass a click-counting method to a child component.

  Researched answer:

  Props are an instance of a state that are passed to components that serve the purpose of displaying information or letting a user interact with information. Once props are in the component, they cannot be modified. Props are public facing information whereas state is more privately held information.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: I know that DOM is Document Object Model so I would surmise that a DOM event is something that happens within a DOM. For example, I have coded some apps that count the number of user clicks that happen in a div element. 

  Researched answer:
  A DOM event is something along the lines of a user hovering over an element in the DOM, a page loading, or keystroke monitoring. DOM events are useful when a developer wants certain functions to be triggered by certain events or actions taken by users.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: 
  In object-oriented programming you design your code based on instances of parent objects. When I was learning React, a component I coded was an instance of the parent Component object. Functional programming prioritizes the use of functions to build more functions. The difference is an OOP approach is that different objects of the same class can inherit similar aspects including functions.

  Researched answer:
  According to Norman Ramsey's famous Stack Overflow Answer: Functional programming is best used when all of the objects are known but may change behavior. OOP is best the other way around. New and popular language make good use of both principles offering classes and inheritance along with reusable functions. OOP principles can even be used to model many functional programming features.




4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  In Ruby a integer is a whole number like 1 or 2. A float is a number with decimal places. When I first was learning Ruby, I noticed that a float will not be returned when I might expect it. For example, when one divides 7 by 2 the answer would be 3 instead of 3.5 because a float was not used originally. However, 7 divided by 2.0 would return the correct quotient of 3.5

  Researched answer:
  Ruby floats are imprecise and require Bigdecimal to be more precise. Integers can be negative or positive as long as they are whole numbers. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: 
  Ruby's implicit return means that the last line of a method is automatically returned without having to use the return keyword. I thought that this was intuitive and helpful when I was practicing writing methods in ruby, because I could code out some steps to get me to the final goal without having to remember to return it. 

  Researched answer:
  Sometimes using explicit return could cause errors if you want the code to return more than one condition. And if the return keyword is before the last line of the method, the last line will be ignored.




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: a variable starting with @ that does not need a declaration. Each instance variable belongs to the object itself. 

2. PostgreSQL: open source database management system that access the databases based on OOP principles

3. Ruby on Rails: framework for writing full stack web apps in Ruby language that divides responsibilities within the app for the database layer, the UI, and the data collection from the database layer.

4. ORM: Object-Relational Mapping - a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using OOP principles. 


5. Active Record: A Rails ORM that takes data from a database and allows it to be used as if it was a Ruby object.
